# Cobalt Mod
(Currently WIP) A mindustry mod that aims to add more unique turrets.

# Turrets
 
 This mod currently only adds turrets, but in the future I plan to add more materials and crafting blocks
 
 - Tornado, a better scatter;
 
 - Storm, a shotgun-like air only turret;
 
 - Sky Taker, long range turret that shoots shrapnel one air enemies;
 
 - Fusion, short range turret that shoots pieces of shrapnel extremely fast; (thanks to a friend of mine, Zockin for helping me remake this sprite!)
 
 - Vorpal, end-game fuse that shoots 5 shots in a more random fashion;
 
 - Expel, a long range turret that shoots bombs to hit ground targets, good to deal with groups of enemies;
 
 - Point-Blank, a direct upgrade from expel, that extra deadly in close range;

# Future changes

 - Some sprite changes;
 
 - New materials;
 
 - More diversity in ammo types;
 
# That's it! Thank you for reading.
